<h2>Where can I stay?</h2>

<p>
RebLaw attempts to house everyone in need of housing for the conference by arranging homestays with Yale Law Students or other students in the area. <b>If you will need housing, you must register by February 1 and indicate that you will need housing on your registration form.</b>

You will have to participate in a mandatory opt-in confirmation later in order to be guaranteed housing. (We'll email you with more details as the conference approaches).

<p>There are also hotels in the area: The Courtyard by Marriott, Omni New Haven Hotel, Colony Inn, Hotel New Haven and Hotel Duncan are all walking distance to the conference. 

<p>Note: Storage WILL NOT be available at the law school. Please arrange to drop any luggage or belongings off at your host's house or hotel.

<h2>Will there be internet access?</h2>

<p>
Yes. Wireless Internet access will be available at the conference. Instructions for access will be provided when you arrive.
