Jerome Cohen is one of the world&#39;s leading experts on Chinese law and legal reform and was instrumental in bringing Mr. Chen to the U.S. after his escape from detention.

It brings together leaders in legal advocacy, academia, and activism to ask how we might challenge the presumptions underlying American border control. How does immigration detention relate to democratic legitimacy? What can lawyers do to contest detention regimes? What is immigration detention actually like? The panel explores each of these difficult questions. In the process, it encourages a rebellious discussion about how lawyers can translate theoretical and ethical concerns about detention into a practical movement for a less carceral world.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_r0ocusugkng5-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Judy Rabinovitz, Deputy Director, ACLU Immigrants&#39; Rights Project, and Adjunct Assistant Professor of Law, NYU School of Law</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Juliet Stumpf, Professor of Law, Lewis &amp; Clark Law School</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Ravi Ragbir, Immigrant rights activist and organizer, New Sanctuary Movement</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Juvenile Justice and Sentencing Reform in Connecticut: A Look at Ongoing Advocacy Efforts</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">In Connecticut, children as young as 14 can be transferred to adult court and receive adult penalties, even life without parole. Currently, there are 272 individuals serving sentences of 10 years or more for crimes that occurred when they were under 18. This spring, the state legislature will consider a bill that would provide &quot;second look&quot; sentence review for these individuals. This panel will describe the current state of juvenile sentencing and highlight ongoing efforts for reform. Advocates will describe diverse strategies for change - from litigation to legislative advocacy to coalition building - and highlight primary arguments for reform, including the effect of the most recent Supreme Court decisions on juvenile sentencing. Attendees will learn about opportunities to get involved in ongoing reform efforts in Connecticut and nationally. </span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_p4hxh35vp43l-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Thomas Ullmann, Clinical Visiting Lecturer, Yale Law School, and Chief Public Defender, New Haven Public Defender&#39;s Office</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Christine Rapillo, Director of Delinquency Defense and Child Protection, Connecticut Office of the Chief Public Defender, and Co-Chair, Steering Committee, Connecticut Juvenile Justice Alliance</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Sarah Russell, Co-Director, Civil Justice Clinic, Quinnipiac University School of Law</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Gary Holder-Winfield, Representative, Connecticut General Assembly</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Angela Hooten, State Policy and Advocacy Director, Center for Reproductive Rights</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Linda Meyer, Professor of Law, Quinnipiac University School of Law (moderator)</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Child Sex Trafficking in the United States: Reforms to End the Criminal Prosecution of Child Victims</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">Child sex trafficking occurs anytime a child under the age of 18 is induced to engage in commercial sex. In the United States, as many as 100,000 children are at risk of being exploited in the commercial sex industry each year, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Although children cannot legally consent to sex, in many states child sex trafficking victims can be arrested and prosecuted for prosecution. This panel will address reform efforts underway around the country to enact &quot;safe harbor&quot; laws so that commercially sexually exploited children are treated as victims in need of special services rather than being criminally prosecuted. Panelists will discuss the role of safe harbor laws in the effort to end child sex trafficking, the progress that has been made in implementing these reforms, and the challenges that remain for advocates. </span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_rhl9zbstne7m-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Lauren Hersh, Director, New York Office, Equality Now</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Katherine Mullen, Attorney, Juvenile Rights Practice, The Legal Aid Society in New York City</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Britanny Vanderhoof, Policy Associate, U.S. Policy Program, Polaris Project</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Sara Lulo, Director, Gruber Program for Global Justice and Women&#39;s Rights,  and Director of International Programs, Yale Law School (moderator)</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Formalizing the Achievement Gap: Race-Based Standards in Education</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">Virginia and Florida have recently passed strategic plans that set race-based academic goals in public schools. For example, in Florida, 86% of white students, but only 74% of black students, are expected to meet grade level mathematical goals in 2018. This panel will discuss the school and community impact of such goals, and more broadly, the power of expectations in public education. Can race-based expectations improve school performance?

As these voices have emerged, they have rapidly changed the terrain of how this work is talked about, while also de-mystifying the dialogue as it has been shaped in previous victim/offender binaries. This panel will include such voices, people who have varying degrees of experience working on the issue, but whose voices have already contributed to the evolution of the discourse and work itself. The question of affected communities comes up a lot when discussing change, and it’s not a simple one. The very channels of communication are usually shaped by the forces that have supported the systems that marginalize and which we seek to reimagine and re-shape. </span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_qm5w5pnwbm2q-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Victoria Coward, mother of murder victim and death penalty repeal advocate</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Edgar De Leon, attorney who has investigated matters such as hate crimes and police misconduct on behalf of the NYPD</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Khalilah Brown-Dean, Associate Professor of Political Science, Quinnipiac University</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Lex Steppling, National Organizer, Equal Justice USA (moderator)</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c10"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Who Controls Your Birth Control? : Contraception Access, Advocacy, and Litigation Today</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">From the Affordable Care Act to state personhood amendments, contraception was all over the news in 2012.

How do ongoing legislative developments, litigation and advocacy efforts relate to the realities faced by health-care providers on the ground?

It aims to contribute to developing connections between legal and activist responses to police suppression of protest and to the harassment and brutalization of poor communities of color in the same cities to challenge these modes of policing. </span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_otwi2r55zwit-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Gideon Oliver, civil rights attorney who has represented hundreds of clients in &quot;protest&quot; cases arising from mass arrests</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Paul A.

This panel will engage speakers from both the BDSM community and the legal world who find themselves on the edge of America&#39;s sexual frontiers. Addressing topics such as play parties, consent and sex work, panelists will challenge audience members to rethink the sexual norms they take for granted and revisit the role law should play in role play, sex work, and other sexual &quot;deviancies.&quot;</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_4lmq532hn73m-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Alexis Agathocleous, Staff Attorney, Government Misconduct and Racial Justice docket, Center for Constitutional Rights</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Judy Guerin, Director, Consent Counts Project, National Coalition for Sexual Freedom</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Ignacio Rivera, Founder, Poly Patao Productions</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Lawyering for Social Enterprise: The Legal Landscape of Alternative Corporate Structures and Triple Bottom Lines</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">This panel will explore the legal architecture of innovative corporate structures, including Benefit Corporations and Flexible Purpose Corporations.

In public advertisements these organizations offer counseling and related services to pregnant women, often by deceptively representing themselves as professional facilities that provide neutral medical information. In reality they are ideological opponents of abortion and they have been known to offer misleading or inaccurate information to the women they purport to serve. Several cities, including Baltimore and San Francisco, have responded to these centers by enacting municipal ordinances requiring truthful disclosure from these centers. The constitutionality of those ordinances have in turn been challenged in court. In this panel we will be discussing ways that local governments and nonprofit agencies can collaborate to confront these Centers and stop them from misleading pregnant women.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_uoimesjbu3z6-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Erin Bernstein, Deputy City Attorney, City of San Francisco</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Suzanne Sangree, Chief Solicitor, Baltimore City Law Department </span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Stephanie Toti, Senior Staff Attorney, Center for Reproductive Rights</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Land Use Conservation Techniques: Protection or Managed Consumption? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">Preservation for purely altruistic motivations is becoming a thing of the past.

Is &quot;progress&quot; in land conservation defined as setting aside more land to remain free from human touch, or simply defining the ways in which humans may best interact with the natural world?

Issues that aren&#39;t frequently in the news but crucially shape our voting process include challenges to voters at the polling place, the nitty-gritty mechanics of different voter registration schemes, the decentralized nature of local election administration, and legal requirements such as the Voting Rights Act&#39;s provisions to help language minorities.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_dzpzkrclpptk-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Justin Levitt, Visiting Professor of Law, Yale Law School</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Glenn Magpantay, Director, Democracy Program, Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Doug Chapin, Director, Program for Excellence in Election Administration, Humphrey School of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Captive Customers: The Movement for Prison Phone Justice</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c5">Individuals who are incarcerated or detained depend on telephone access to maintain contact with their families and loved ones. Regular contact ensures the well-being of family members separated by the incarceration system, and fosters the successful reintegration of individuals upon release. Maintaining family contact comes at a cost, however. The telephone system within state prisons and immigration detention centers exploit the most vulnerable among us by charging exorbitant rates. The high rates are the result of a commission system, under which a substantial portion of phone revenue is paid from the phone company to the state or local government. In some states, the commission is as high as 65 percent. Panelists will discuss the national campaign for prison phone justice, including the recently issued Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the FCC; lessons from local efforts, with an emphasis on successful campaign in New York; and the impact of unjust phone rates on immigrant detainees.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_9t0h253vcs6x-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Annette Dickerson, Director of Education and Outreach, Center for Constitutional Rights</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Paul Wright, Executive Director, Human Rights Defense Center, and Editor, Prison Legal News</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Mel Motel, Paralegal and Research Associate, Human Rights Defense Center</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Leila Kang, J.D.

That it’s time for law students across the country to begin the national conversation about changing the legal profession, about taking back our law schools, and about bringing justice and dignity to our work. Come join us for a workshop to discuss efforts students have already taken at their schools and to share ideas about what could work at yours. Learn about successes and setbacks other students have faced in challenging their school cultures and administrations. More than anything, come help us start a national movement to breathe strength, courage, and unity into the battles we’ve been fighting alone, at each of our schools, for far too long.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_wzals7fpdzba-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Sean Hamidi, J.D.

Despite this fact, many communities remain underserved and victimized with little access to--or even knowledge of--their legal rights.  For justice-seeking practitioners of the law, these chronically-affected communities present special challenges that need to be overcome to be better served.  In the Latino community specifically, questions of immigration status and fear of deportation are often at the forefront of this group’s mindset when attempting to seek the legal protections constitutionally afforded to them.  Additional challenges arise when the crimes committed against members of the Latino community are sexual in nature and involve children, as these fields are often ripe with culturally-reinforced stigma and taboo that too often result in silence and inaction for many victims.  Join California Senator Martha Escutia (ret.) and attorney John C. Manly for a discussion about their work to end childhood sexual abuse within Latino communities and the obstacles such work can present. </span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_shbcivne3m3z-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Martha Escutia, Senator (retired), California State Senate, and Attorney, The Senators (Ret.)

The panel aims to examine whether and how these different factors are related to one another and to understand how they can be brought to bear on developing a transparent regime that attracts investments and contributes to the progressive development of human rights in host countries. The panel will be conducted in a workshop format. While Peter Rosenblum shall focus on human rights aspects and transparency in the context of investment agreements, Lise Johnson will concentrate on transparency and the relevance of international human rights law in the context of Investor-State arbitration.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_j2ymt9ra1wdu-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Peter Rosenblum, Clinical Professor in Human Rights, Columbia Law School</span></li><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Lise Johnson, Lead Investment Law and Policy Researcher, Vale Columbia Center on Sustainable International Investment</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c4">Screenings sub-page content:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12">RebLaw2013 Film Screenings</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c2">Unequal Justice: The Relentless Rise of the 1% Court</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2 c4 c5">Unequal Justice: The Relentless Rise of the 1% Court </span><span class="c2 c5">explores the growing pro-corporate bias in key Court decisions and their real-world impact on ordinary Americans. Steadily and relentlessly, the Court has been transformed into an institution that frequently serves the interests of the wealthiest one percent.Taking judicial activism to new levels, these justices have rendered a series of pivotal cases to fundamentally change the balance of power in American society, favoring business interests and limiting access to legal remedies for everyone else. These decisions threaten to undermine the core concept of fairness that is embodied in the motto carved into the Supreme Court building, turning Equal Justice Under Law into Unequal Justice Under Law.</span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_1p9cmrbvqzbl-0 start"><li class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Nan Aron, President, Alliance for Justice (presenter)</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
